# **Machine Learning Projects**  

This repository contains three machine learning projects: **Movie Genre Classification, Credit Card Fraud Detection, and Customer Churn Prediction**. Each project applies different machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems using structured and unstructured data.  

## **Projects Overview**  

### **1. Movie Genre Classification**  
This project predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual description. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful features from text and classify them into genres.  

#### **Technologies & Techniques Used:**  
- **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)  
- **Algorithms:** NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall  

#### **Dataset:**  
- Used a dataset containing movie plot summaries along with their respective genres.  

#### **Results:**  
- Achieved good accuracy with **Logistic Regression and SVM models** after fine-tuning hyperparameters.

### **2. Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction details. The goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical data.  

#### **Technologies & Techniques Used:**  
- **Feature Engineering:** Handling imbalanced data, Scaling, PCA  
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC Score, Confusion Matrix  

#### **Dataset:**  
- Used a dataset with anonymized credit card transactions, including transaction amount, timestamp, and other features.  

#### **Results:**  
- ðŸ”¹ Model: Random Forest
Accuracy: 0.9996
Precision: 0.9524
Recall: 0.8163
F1-Score: 0.8791
ROC AUC: 0.9578

### **3. Customer Churn Prediction**  
This project predicts customer churn for a subscription-based service by analyzing historical customer data, including demographics and usage behavior.  

#### **Technologies & Techniques Used:**  
- **Feature Engineering:** Handling missing values, One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling  
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix  

#### **Dataset:**  
- The dataset contains customer details, usage patterns, and churn labels (whether a customer left the service or not).  

#### **Results:**  
- Gradient Boosting performed best with an **accuracy of 0.87%**.
